"""
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6

Example 2:
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
