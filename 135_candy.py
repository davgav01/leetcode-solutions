There are n children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the array ratings.

You are giving candies to these children such that:
- Each child must receive at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candy than their neighbors with a lower rating.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to give to the children.

Example 1:
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4

Constraints:
n == ratings.length
1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 10^4
