# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains Python solutions and templates for various LeetCode problems. Each file is dedicated to a specific problem and includes:

- A detailed problem description header (copied from LeetCode)
- The direct link to the problem statement
- Example inputs and outputs
- Constraints and follow-up questions (if any)
- A class-based Python solution, following LeetCode's standard format

## Structure
- Each problem is in its own file, named after the problem (e.g., `two_sum.py`, `add_two_numbers.py`).
- The top of each file contains a docstring with the problem description, examples, and constraints.
- The solution is implemented as a class with the appropriate method signature.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-solutions.git
   cd leetcode-solutions
   ```
2. Open any problem file (e.g., `two_sum.py`) to view the problem description and the solution.
3. You can run the solution files directly or import the classes/methods into your own scripts for testing.

## Template generation prompt
Create template files for leetcode problems 51-55. It should include a comment block at the top which includes the question, examples and constraints. Then the empty solution class template for python. Follow the file naming convention already in place in the directory. Make sure to include the class solution template the same as it appears on leetcode, including the empty methods etc.
