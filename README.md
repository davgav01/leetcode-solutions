# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains Python solutions and templates for various LeetCode problems. Each file is dedicated to a specific problem and includes:

- A detailed problem description header (copied from LeetCode)
- The direct link to the problem statement
- Example inputs and outputs
- Constraints and follow-up questions (if any)
- A class-based Python solution, following LeetCode's standard format

## Structure
- Each problem is in its own file, named after the problem (e.g., `two_sum.py`, `add_two_numbers.py`).
- The top of each file contains a docstring with the problem description, examples, and constraints.
- The solution is implemented as a class with the appropriate method signature.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/leetcode-solutions.git
   cd leetcode-solutions
   ```
2. Open any problem file (e.g., `two_sum.py`) to view the problem description and the solution.
3. You can run the solution files directly or import the classes/methods into your own scripts for testing.
