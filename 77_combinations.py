"""
Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers chosen from the range [1, n].

You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]]
Explanation: There are 6 combinations of 2 numbers from 1 to 4 (the order of elements does not matter).

Example 2:
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: [[1]]
Explanation: There is 1 combination of 1 number from 1 to 1.

Constraints:
1 <= n <= 20
1 <= k <= n
