"""
Given a binary tree, populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: [1,#,2,#,3,#]

Example 2:
Input: root = []
Output: []

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 6000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

Follow up:
You may only use constant extra space.
You must modify the tree in-place.
